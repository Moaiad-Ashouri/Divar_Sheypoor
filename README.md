# Divar_Sheypoor

Hi everyone , i was looking for renting an apartment , it was not easy to check renting websites day to day, so i created this script to automate the search and get the result every hour. it helped me so i hope it will help you as well.

To start go to Divar and Sheypoor websites and filter the results as your needs then copy the url and paste it into Divar_URL and Sheypoor_URL variables.
then install Discord and create an account then follow this steps (https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to create a WebHook and put it into WebHook_URL variable.
after that just install the requirements and run the script.

Enjoy
